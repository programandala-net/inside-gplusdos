_Inside G+DOS_ is the title of an article series written by Stephen
Warr for the Format magazine.

G+DOS is the disk operating system of the ZX Spectrum's Plus D
interface.

By the time Stephen Warr wrote these articles he was writing also
Uni-DOS, an improved version of G+DOS for Plus D and DISCiPLE.

The goal of this project is to restore the original texts from the
scanned issues of the magazine, which can be downloaded from
http://worldofspectrum.org[World of Spectrum], and convert them to
http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor] format, in order to make them
easier to study.
