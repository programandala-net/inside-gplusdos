== Description

_Inside G+DOS_ is the title of an article series written by Stephen
Warr for the _Format_ magazine. It was published in 5 parts, from
Volume 2 Number 8 (1989-04) to Volume 3 Number 8 (1990-04).

G+DOS is the disk operating system of the ZX Spectrum's Plus D
interface, by MGT.

By the time Stephen Warr wrote these articles he was developing
Uni-DOS, an improved version of G+DOS for Plus D and DISCiPLE (the
older brother of the Plus D, also by MGT).

== Motivation and goal

I found this article series in 2016, while searching the _Format_
magazine (which can be found in JPEG and PDF formats in the archive of
http://worldspectrum.org[World of Spectrum]) for detailed information
on G+DOS, during the development of
http://programandala.net/en.program.solo_forth.html[Solo Forth], and
it was very useful.

In order to make the original articles easier to read and study, and
also to preserve them for the future, I started converting the
original scanned pages into an Asciidoctor document, which can be
automatically converted to any other modern format.

== Differences from the original

- All addresses are also in hexadecimal (in the original, some
  addresses were only in decimal).

== Tools used

- pdfimages and pdftoppm (from
  http://poppler.freedesktop.org[poppler-utils])
- http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-orc[tesseract]
- http://vim.org[Vim]
- http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor]

All of them running on http://raspbian.org[Raspbian] in a
http://raspberrypi.org[Raspberry Pi 2].
